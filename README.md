## Dependencies

What you need:

* An ES6/ES2015 supported browser
* A keyboard (sorry to mouse-only users!)

## How to Play

### Access

From the root directory open the `index.html` file into an ES6-supported browser.

### Rules

The playable character starts at the bottom center tile of the board. Help him navigate safely to the top by using your arrow keys or WASD keys while avoiding the enemy bugs. If he touches any enemies he'll get sent back to the beginning to start the journey all over again.
